## Welcome

[Architecture for Humanity Denver](http://denver.architectureforhumanity.org/) (AfH) and [Open Tech Forever](http://www.opentechforever.com) (OTF) are demonstrating that it is possible to build an open source, compressed earth block (CEB) house that meets the [Living Building Challenge 2.1](http://living-future.org/lbc) standard.

We invite you to join our international call to action. Enter the contest and help us design a CEB home that we will build in the Spring of 2014 on our 40 acre site in Denver, Colorado.

We will document each home design and the systemic body of knowledge that informs this process, so that anyone in the world can both learn from and contribute to the project. This is an **open source house for the world**. The _Forever Home_.

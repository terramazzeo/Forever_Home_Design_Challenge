## Welcome

[Architecture for Humanity Denver](http://denver.architectureforhumanity.org/) (AfH) and [Open Tech Forever](http://www.opentechforever.com) (OTF) are demonstrating that it is possible to build an open source, compressed earth block (CEB) house that meets the [Living Building Challenge 2.1](http://living-future.org/lbc) standard.

We invite you to join our international call to action. Enter the contest and help us design a CEB home that we will build in the Spring of 2014 on our 40 acre site in Denver, Colorado.

We will document each home design and the systemic body of knowledge that informs this process, so that anyone in the world can both learn from and contribute to the project. This is an **open source house for the world**. The _Forever Home_.

## Collaborate With Us

Throughout the duration of the design challenge, we invite you to **contribute to the wiki** and join us for online **video hangouts** with sustainable building experts.

### Contributing to the Wiki

You happen to be on the Forever Home Design Challenge Wiki right now. We encourage you to add information about compressed earth block construction and other relevant forms of green building. Here's a handy list of instructions to help you get started:

1. <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">Create a Github account</a> <small>(or click _Sign In_ at the top of this page to log in with Google/Facebook/Twitter)</small>.
2. When logged in, you will see an option at the top of this page to create new wiki pages or edit existing ones. A great example would be a page called _Building Permits_ covering how to set yourself up for success when applying for a permit. Actionable knowledge is key.

### Video Hangouts With Experts

Check back or check your email inbox for news about upcoming online events. Our goal is to learn from one another and document/share what we discover for the benefit of everyone.

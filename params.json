Enter the contest and help us design a CEB home that we will build in the Spring of 2014 on our 40 acre site in Denver, Colorado.\r\n\r\nWe will document each home design and the systemic body of knowledge that informs this process, so that anyone in the world can both learn from and contribute to the project. This is an **open source house for the world**. The _Forever Home_. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
